# surfs_up

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is gather information on temperature trends before the investor opens a surf shop. This called specifically for June and December months, to decide whether it is sustainable to open the surf shop all year long. We used {ython, Pandas, and SQLAlchemy to retrieve all temperatures for the month of June and generate summary statistics. The process was the same for December month as well.

## Results

3 key differences
Based on the data, the average temperature in June was slightly higher than in December, by a little over 3. 

## Summary

Comparing June and December weather statistics, temperature and climate is relatively close, without being skewed too far in any direction. Thus, the shop could reasonably be open year-around.
